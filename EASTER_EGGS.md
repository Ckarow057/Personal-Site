## 🌟 Developer Notes

All Easter eggs are implemented in:
- `/src/components/EasterEggs.jsx` - Main Easter egg system
- `/src/components/EasterEggs.css` - Easter egg styles
- Individual components have their own hidden features

The achievement system persists during your session but resets on page reload (no cookies or localStorage used - privacy first!).

## 🎉 Have Fun!
